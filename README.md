# kubelt/web3-publish

Kubelt is the easiest way to publish content on web3. This action uses our SDK
to publish your content to IPFS using our backend.

## Quickstart

Follow these steps to create a workflow that pushes your content to IPFS. See 
the [GitHub Actions Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart)
for more information.

In your repo create a directory `workflow` directory in the `.github` directory:

```bash
$ mkdir -p .guthub/workflow
```

In the `workflow` directory create a yaml file (for example `build.yaml`) with
these contents:

```yaml
---
name: web3 deploy

on:  # yamllint disable-line rule:truthy
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    tags:
      - '*'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Publish data/ to web3
        id: data
        uses: kubelt/web3-publish@v0-pre-alpha
        with:
          secret: ${{ secrets.NAME_PUBLISHING_KEY }}
          glob: "./data"
          published: true

      - run: echo '${{ steps.data.outputs.roots }}' >> output.json

      - name: Save output
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: output
          path: ./output.js
```

This workflow checks out the current repo and publishes its `data/` folder to
IPFS. You could also, for example, run a build here and publish `dist/`.

It then saves the results of the publishing action to a JSON file called
`output.json` as a build artifact (as a zipfile).

Commit the `.github` directory and the action will run. View the logs and the 
`output.zip` artifact to see results.

## API Reference

The key config values are `secret`, `glob`, and `published` here:

```yaml
      - name: Publish data/ to web3
        id: data
        uses: kubelt/web3-publish@v0-pre-alpha
        with:
          secret: ${{ secrets.NAME_PUBLISHING_KEY }}
          glob: "./data"
          published: true
```

- `secret` is a deterministically derived keypair used for authentication,
signature validation, and content naming. Currenly any string is accepted (use a
secure, long string stored from a password generator), but this will rapidly
tighten. To store `secret` securely (as above) use [Encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).
- `glob` is a [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) pattern. All
files that match the pattern are named and published, currently.
- `published` is a boolean that controls whether the content is published to
IPFS. If `false` names and metadata are created. If `true` names and metadata
are created and the content is pinned on IPFS.

## `curl` Workflow

These examples use included test fixture data to illustrate the capabilities of
the publishing API by accessing it directly.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://pndo-worker.alfl-dev.workers.dev/v0/api/content/kbt/abc123" \
 -H "X-Public-Key: my_secret_key"  \
 -H "X-Signature: my_secret_key"   \
 -F file=@test/fixtures/unrevealed.car \
 -F metadata='{"published": false}'
```

The response will come back `{"expirationTtl":86400,"metadata":{"published":false,"box":{"cid":"unpublished"}}}`
which we pretty print (with `jq`):

```json
{
  "expirationTtl": 86400,
  "metadata": {
    "published": false,
    "box": {
      "cid": "unpublished"
    }
  }
}
```

Now we `curl` the name to see what we get back:

```bash
curl "https://pndo-worker.alfl-dev.workers.dev/v0/api/content/kbt/abc123"
```

Which returns:

```bash
unpublished
```

Now let's flip the `published` flag:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://pndo-worker.alfl-dev.workers.dev/v0/api/content/kbt/abc123" \
 -H "X-Public-Key: my_secret_key"  \
 -H "X-Signature: my_secret_key"   \
 -F file=@test/fixtures/unrevealed.car \
 -F metadata='{"published": true}'
```

Which we pretty print (with `jq`):

```json
{
  "expirationTtl": 86400,
  "metadata": {
    "published": true,
    "box": {
      "cid": "bafyreid7jv35hibnc3fq2nzacom57gihwfh5e4yp5onoyf2vosybfjf4ua"
    }
  }
}
```

Now when we `curl` the name:

```bash
curl "https://pndo-worker.alfl-dev.workers.dev/v0/api/content/kbt/abc123"
```

We see:

```
bafyreid7jv35hibnc3fq2nzacom57gihwfh5e4yp5onoyf2vosybfjf4ua
```

And we can chain calls to get the data directly out of IPFS:

```bash
curl "https://pndo-worker.alfl-dev.workers.dev/v0/api/content/kbt/abc123" | ipfs dag get | jq
```

Which pretty prints:

```json
{
  "description": "Sealed Courtyard Genesis Pack (00d66d26b9bf6f785af036300051f8d6ef30bc0fc0d74016bb14c6c0ce462d8c)",
  "name": "Courtyard Genesis Pack"
}
```

Now we can publish new content addressed by the same name (`abc123` in this case):

```bash
curl -X POST "https://pndo-worker.alfl-dev.workers.dev/v0/api/content/kbt/abc123" \
 -H "X-Public-Key: my_secret_key"  \
 -H "X-Signature: my_secret_key"   \
 -F file=@test/fixtures/revealed.car \
 -F metadata='{"published": true}'
```

Note that the cid in the response has changed. With the same call as above:

```bash
curl "https://pndo-worker.alfl-dev.workers.dev/v0/api/content/kbt/abc123" | ipfs dag get | jq
```

Which pretty prints:

```json
{
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Grade",
      "value": "PSA 10"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Grade Label",
      "value": "GEM-MT"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Year",
      "value": "2002"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Language",
      "value": "Japanese"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Type",
      "value": "Electric"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Set",
      "value": "Other"
    },
    {
      "value": "Holo"
    }
  ],
  "description": "PSA Graded Pokemon Card | PSA #42876452 | Grade PSA 10 (GEM-MT)",
  "fingerprint": {
    "hash": "00d66d26b9bf6f785af036300051f8d6ef30bc0fc0d74016bb14c6c0ce462d8c",
    "id": "2002 Pokemon Japanese McDonald's Holo Pikachu #010 | PSA #42876452 | PSA 10 (GEM-MT)",
    "method": "keccak256(bytes(fingerprint_id))"
  },
  "name": "2002 Pokemon Japanese McDonald's Holo Pikachu #010",
  "pkmn": "Pikachu",
  "pokedex_no": "025",
  "psa_serial": "42876452"
}
```

The `abc123` stable name has now been re-linked to new data.
